This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based city skyline visualization. It consists of layered background and foreground buildings, each styled with nested div elements to represent windows and building details. The external styles.css file defines the shapes, colors, and structure of the skyline, creating a visually appealing representation suitable for static or animated webpage designs.
